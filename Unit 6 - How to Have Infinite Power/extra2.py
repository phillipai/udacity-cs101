# Double Gold Star

# Khayyam Triangle

# The French mathematician, Blaise Pascal, who built a mechanical computer in
# the 17th century, studied a pattern of numbers now commonly known in parts of
# the world as Pascal's Triangle (it was also previously studied by many Indian,
# Chinese, and Persian mathematicians, and is known by different names in other
# parts of the world).

# The pattern is shown below:

#                    1
#                   1 1
#                  1 2 1
#                 1 3 3 1
#                1 4 6 4 1
#                   ...

# Each number is the sum of the number above it to the left and the number above
# it to the right (any missing numbers are counted as 0).

# Define a procedure, triangle(n), that takes a number n as its input, and
# returns a list of the first n rows in the triangle. Each element of the
# returned list should be a list of the numbers at the corresponding row in the
# triangle.


def pascal(n):
    if n==0:
        return [1]
    else:
        N = pascal(n-1)
        return [1] + [N[i] + N[i+1] for i in range(n-1)] + [1]


def triangle(n):
    list = []
    for i in range(n):
        list.append(pascal(i))
    return list
  

#For example:

#print triangle(0)
#>>> []

#print triangle(1)
#>>> [[1]]

#print triangle(2)
#>> [[1], [1, 1]]

print triangle(3)
#>>> [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1]]

#print triangle(6)
#>>> [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1], [1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1]]
